Scan the entities with one "Tags Based" common interface.

Scan:

* buffers to switch to;
* files to open;
* windows and tabs to switch to;
* files like `c++`, `python`, `vim`, `sco`, `html` and more (on request) to
  jump to things like *constructors*, *objects*, *methods*, etc;
* your *ctags* database to browse source code;
* definition and declaration of methods;
* vim's registers to paste text;
* current file changes to move to;
* vim marks to jump to;

and more (on request).

Create your own scans to browse things related to your workflow.

To look at a sample of how to create your own scan, just select any file at
`~/.vim/autoload/railmoon/oscan/extractor/`
for example:  `~/.vim/autoload/railmoon/oscan/extractor/buffers.vim`
